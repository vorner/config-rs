# config-rs

This is a (hopefully temporary) fork of
[config](https://crates.io/crates/config), as used by the
[spirit](https://crates.io/crates/spirit) framework. The upstream is slow
integrating pull requests.

Please use the original if possible. This crate is considered private dependency
of spirit, it's API can change without warning and will be discontinued once
there's no need of it.
